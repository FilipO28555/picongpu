Thermal electron benchmark
==========================

.. sectionauthor:: Rene Widera <r.widera (at) hzdr.de>

This setup simulates a homogeneous electron plasma.
There are 25 macro-particles per cell which sample a homogeneous distribution of relativistic electrons
at a density of ρWP = −10^20 e/m3.
Their initial momenta are normally distributed along each spatial dimension with a variance of 17.5 m^2c^2,
resulting in a distribution of initial total momentum according to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with most
probable kinetic energy of 5 mc^2.
