    This ionization model is based on the assumption of an "ion sphere", constructed based on describing electrons as a
    density, a point charge atomic core and a finite atomic potential as a result of matter density.

    In this framework ionization may occur due to due to overlap of adjacent ion spheres lowering the ionization barrier
    and causing electrons to become quasi-free in the system, being bound in resonance states.

    This model is used to calculate an average ionization degree with respect to local charge density and temperature.
    This is extenden to arbitrary temperatures and atoms through fitting parameters and temperature cutoffs.
