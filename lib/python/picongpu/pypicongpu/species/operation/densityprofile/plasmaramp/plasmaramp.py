        **Problem:** Plasma Ramps are polymorph, there are several distinct
        implementations, each of them has its respective schema.

        In the template we need know which exact sub type of the general
        abstract type was used to generate the correct code.

        This is difficult in JSON (particularly in a mustache-compatible way)
        since no type information is available in the schema.

        **Solution:** We store which type was actually used in a wrapper
        in addition to actual data,
            provided as usual by get_rendering_context() by the plasma ramp
            instance

        If a generic plasma ramp is requested we us the wrapper schema for this
        class which contains the **type** meta information and the **data**
        content

        E.g.:

        .. code::

            {
                "type": {
                    "uniform": true,
                    "gaussian": false,
                    ...
                },
                "data": DATA
            }

        where DATA is the serialization as returned by get_rendering_context().

        There are *two* context serialization methods for density profiles:

        - get_rendering_context()
            - provided by RenderedObject parent class, serialization ("context
              building") performed by _get_serialized()
            - _get_serialized() implemented in *every plasma ramp*
            - checks against schema of respective plasma ramp
            - returned context is a representation of
                    *exactly this plasma ramp*
            - (left empty == not implemented in parent PlasmaRamp)

        - get_generic_profile_rendering_context()
            - implemented in parent PlasmaRamp
            - returned representation is generic for *any plasma ramp*
              (i.e. contains which type is actually used)
            - passes information from get_rendering_context() through
            - returned representation is designed for easy use with templating
              engine mustache
